# VescUart

Arduino library for interfacing with the VESC over UART. This library is based upon the library written by RollingGecko (https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl), only updated for the newest VESC firmware (FW3.40) and cleaned up at bit.

!Important! This is not a dropin replacement for RollingGeckos library. You will have to make some changes to your software, as this is now all within a class.
